      <p>
        A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that
        interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather
        than loading entire new pages from the server. This approach avoids
        interruption of the user experience between successive pages, making the
        application feel more like a desktop application.

              Interactions do not require a round trip to the server, which
              means the page does not reload.

        SPAs can be built using various frameworks including React, Angular, and
        Vue.js. While React is commonly used for SPAs, it is also suitable for
        adding interactivity to existing multi-page applications.
